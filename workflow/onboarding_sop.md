# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Library and Dependency Onboarding

## 1. Purpose
This SOP establishes a standardized process for onboarding new libraries and dependencies into the organization's codebase. Proper onboarding ensures that all additions are vetted for compatibility, security, and maintainability, thereby maintaining the integrity and quality of the software projects.

## 2. Scope
This procedure applies to all developers, project managers, and team leads involved in selecting, integrating, and managing libraries and dependencies within the organization's projects. It covers the evaluation, approval, integration, and maintenance of external libraries and dependencies.

## 3. Definitions
- **Library/Dependency**: External code packages or modules that provide specific functionalities and are integrated into the codebase to extend its capabilities.
- **Onboarding Coordinator**: The individual responsible for managing the library and dependency onboarding process.
- **Dependency Manager**: Tools or systems (e.g., npm, Maven, pip) used to manage project dependencies.
- **Version Control**: Systems (e.g., Git) that track changes to the codebase and manage different versions of the project.

## 4. Responsibilities
- **Developers**:
  - Identify the need for new libraries or dependencies based on project requirements.
  - Conduct preliminary research on potential libraries.
  - Document the purpose and benefits of the proposed library.
- **Onboarding Coordinator**:
  - Review and evaluate proposed libraries for alignment with project standards.
  - Coordinate with relevant stakeholders for approval.
  - Manage the integration and documentation of approved libraries.
- **Security Team**:
  - Assess the security implications of new libraries.
  - Ensure that libraries comply with the organization's security policies.
- **Project Managers**:
  - Oversee the onboarding process to ensure timely integration.
  - Allocate resources for evaluating and integrating new libraries.

## 5. Procedure

### 5.1. Identification and Proposal
1. **Identify Need**:
   - Determine the requirement for a new library or dependency based on project functionality, performance, or other criteria.
2. **Research Options**:
   - Investigate available libraries that can fulfill the identified need.
   - Compare features, performance, community support, and licensing.
3. **Prepare Proposal**:
   - Document the selected library's purpose, benefits, potential risks, and alternatives.
   - Include links to documentation, repositories, and any relevant benchmarks or reviews.

### 5.2. Evaluation and Approval
1. **Initial Review**:
   - Submit the library proposal to the Onboarding Coordinator for preliminary assessment.
2. **Compatibility Assessment**:
   - Ensure the library is compatible with the existing codebase, frameworks, and technology stack.
3. **Security Assessment**:
   - Conduct a security review to identify potential vulnerabilities.
   - Utilize tools or consult the Security Team for a thorough analysis.
4. **License Compliance**:
   - Verify that the library's license is compatible with the project's licensing and does not impose restrictive terms.
5. **Stakeholder Approval**:
   - Present the evaluation findings to project stakeholders for final approval.
   - Address any concerns or feedback provided by stakeholders.

### 5.3. Integration
1. **Dependency Management Setup**:
   - Use the appropriate dependency manager (e.g., npm, Maven, pip) to add the library to the project.
2. **Version Specification**:
   - Specify the exact version of the library to ensure consistency across development environments.
   - Avoid using wildcard versions to prevent unexpected updates.
3. **Configuration**:
   - Configure the library as per the project's requirements.
   - Update configuration files or environment settings as necessary.
4. **Initial Testing**:
   - Conduct tests to verify that the library integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase.
   - Ensure that there are no conflicts or performance issues introduced.

### 5.4. Documentation
1. **Update Documentation**:
   - Document the added library, including its purpose, usage guidelines, and any configuration details.
   - Update the project's README or dependency documentation to reflect the new addition.
2. **Code Comments**:
   - Add inline comments in the codebase where the library is utilized to explain its purpose and usage.
3. **Onboarding Checklist**:
   - Update the onboarding checklist to include steps related to the new library if necessary.

### 5.5. Maintenance and Updates
1. **Monitor Library Updates**:
   - Regularly check for updates or patches released for the library.
   - Assess the need for updating based on new features, bug fixes, or security patches.
2. **Version Upgrades**:
   - Follow the same evaluation and approval process for upgrading to newer versions of the library.
   - Test thoroughly to ensure that updates do not introduce regressions.
3. **Deprecation Management**:
   - Identify when a library becomes deprecated or unsupported.
   - Plan and execute the replacement or removal of deprecated libraries to maintain codebase health.

## 6. Best Practices
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only add libraries that are essential to reduce complexity and potential security risks.
- **Active Maintenance**: Prefer libraries that are actively maintained and have a strong community presence.
- **Performance Considerations**: Evaluate the performance impact of integrating new libraries to ensure they do not degrade application performance.
- **Clear Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for all integrated libraries to facilitate onboarding and future maintenance.
- **Regular Audits**: Periodically review all dependencies to ensure they remain necessary, secure, and up-to-date.
