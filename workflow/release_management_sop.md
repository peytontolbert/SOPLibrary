# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Release Management

## 1. Purpose
This SOP defines the standardized process for managing software releases within the organization. Effective release management ensures that software is delivered in a controlled, predictable, and efficient manner, maintaining quality and minimizing disruptions to users and stakeholders.

## 2. Scope
This procedure applies to all development teams, project managers, quality assurance (QA) teams, operations, and any other stakeholders involved in the release process across all projects within the organization.

## 3. Definitions
- **Release**: A version of the software that is made available for deployment to users or customers.
- **Release Manager**: The individual responsible for overseeing the release process.
- **Release Candidate (RC)**: A version of the software that is potentially final, unless significant bugs emerge.
- **Deployment**: The process of making the release available to users or a production environment.
- **Rollback**: The process of reverting to a previous software version in case of issues with the release.

## 4. Responsibilities
- **Release Manager**:
  - Plan and schedule releases.
  - Coordinate with development, QA, and operations teams.
  - Ensure compliance with release policies and procedures.
  - Manage release documentation and communication.
- **Developers**:
  - Provide stable code for release.
  - Address bugs and issues identified during testing.
- **QA Team**:
  - Conduct thorough testing of release candidates.
  - Validate that the release meets quality standards.
- **Operations Team**:
  - Prepare the deployment environment.
  - Execute the deployment process.
  - Monitor the release post-deployment.
- **Project Managers**:
  - Ensure that release milestones align with project timelines.
  - Communicate release status to stakeholders.

## 5. Procedure

### 5.1. Release Planning
1. **Define Release Objectives**:
   - Identify the goals and features for the release.
   - Align release objectives with project and business goals.
2. **Create Release Schedule**:
   - Establish timelines for development, testing, and deployment.
   - Identify key milestones and deadlines.
3. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Assign roles and responsibilities to team members.
   - Ensure the availability of necessary resources and tools.

### 5.2. Development and Preparation
1. **Feature Completion**:
   - Ensure all planned features are developed and code is merged into the develop branch.
2. **Freeze Code Base**:
   - Implement a code freeze to stabilize the codebase for testing.
3. **Build Release Candidate**:
   - Create a release candidate from the develop branch.
   - Tag the release candidate appropriately (e.g., v1.0.0-rc1).

### 5.3. Testing
1. **Unit and Integration Testing**:
   - Perform unit tests on individual components.
   - Conduct integration tests to ensure components work together properly.
2. **System Testing**:
   - Validate the complete and integrated software for compliance with requirements.
3. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**:
   - Facilitate UAT sessions with end-users or stakeholders to ensure the release meets their needs.
4. **Bug Fixing**:
   - Address and resolve any bugs or issues identified during testing phases.
   - Iterate on testing and bug fixing until the release reaches acceptable quality.

### 5.4. Release Approval
1. **Review Test Results**:
   - Assess the outcomes of all testing phases.
   - Confirm that all critical issues have been resolved.
2. **Obtain Approval**:
   - Secure formal approval from project leads or stakeholders to proceed with the release.
   - Update the release documentation to reflect approval.

### 5.5. Deployment
1. **Prepare Deployment Plan**:
   - Outline steps for deployment, including pre-deployment checks, deployment scripts, and post-deployment tasks.
2. **Backup Current Production**:
   - Create backups of the current production environment to enable rollback if necessary.
3. **Execute Deployment**:
   - Deploy the release candidate to the production environment following the deployment plan.
4. **Post-Deployment Verification**:
   - Conduct smoke testing to ensure the release is functioning as expected in the production environment.
   - Monitor systems for any issues or anomalies.

### 5.6. Post-Release Activities
1. **Documentation Update**:
   - Update all relevant documentation to reflect changes in the new release.
2. **Release Notes**:
   - Prepare and distribute release notes detailing new features, bug fixes, and known issues.
3. **Stakeholder Communication**:
   - Inform stakeholders about the successful release and any necessary actions they need to take.
4. **Feedback Collection**:
   - Gather feedback from users and stakeholders to identify areas for improvement in future releases.

### 5.7. Rollback Procedures
1. **Identify Rollback Triggers**:
   - Establish criteria for when a rollback is necessary (e.g., critical bugs, major performance issues).
2. **Execute Rollback Plan**:
   - Follow the predefined rollback procedures to revert to the previous stable release.
3. **Post-Rollback Verification**:
   - Ensure that the rollback has been successful and that the previous release is fully operational.

## 6. Best Practices
- **Early and Continuous Planning**: Plan releases well in advance and adapt as needed throughout the development cycle.
- **Clear Communication**: Maintain transparent communication among all stakeholders throughout the release process.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Ensure thorough testing at each stage to identify and resolve issues early.
- **Documentation**: Keep detailed and up-to-date documentation to support the release process and future maintenance.
- **Automation**: Utilize automation tools for building, testing, and deploying releases to increase efficiency and reduce errors.
- **Post-Mortem Analysis**: Conduct a post-release review to assess what went well and identify areas for improvement.
