# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Code Review

## 1. Purpose
This SOP outlines the standardized process for conducting code reviews to ensure code quality, maintainability, and compliance with project standards. Effective code reviews enhance collaboration, identify defects early, and promote knowledge sharing among team members.

## 2. Scope
This procedure applies to all developers and team members involved in writing, reviewing, and approving code within the organizationâ€™s projects.

## 3. Definitions
- **Code Review**: A systematic examination of source code intended to find and fix mistakes overlooked in the initial development phase.
- **Reviewer**: A team member responsible for examining the code changes.
- **Author**: The developer who wrote the code being reviewed.
- **Pull Request (PR)**: A method of submitting contributions to a project by requesting that changes be merged into the main codebase.

## 4. Responsibilities
- **Authors**:
  - Write clear, maintainable, and well-documented code.
  - Ensure code complies with the project's coding standards and guidelines.
  - Submit code changes through pull requests for review.
- **Reviewers**:
  - Examine the code changes thoroughly for correctness, efficiency, and style.
  - Provide constructive feedback and suggest improvements.
  - Approve or request changes on pull requests in a timely manner.
- **Project Leads**:
  - Ensure that code reviews are conducted consistently across the project.
  - Resolve any disputes arising from code reviews.

## 5. Procedure

### 5.1. Preparing for Code Review
1. **Complete Development**: Ensure that the code is complete, thoroughly tested locally, and free of known issues before submission.
2. **Adhere to Standards**: Confirm that the code follows established coding standards, naming conventions, and architectural guidelines.
3. **Documentation**: Update or add necessary documentation, including inline comments and relevant external documents.
4. **Create Pull Request**: Submit a pull request via the version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab), clearly describing the changes and their purpose.

### 5.2. Conducting the Review
1. **Assignment**: The system or project lead assigns one or more reviewers to the pull request.
2. **Examination**:
   - **Functionality**: Verify that the code functions as intended and meets all requirements.
   - **Code Quality**: Assess the code for readability, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards.
   - **Performance**: Check for any potential performance issues or inefficiencies.
   - **Security**: Identify any security vulnerabilities or potential exposures.
   - **Testing**: Ensure that appropriate tests are written and existing tests pass.
   - **Documentation**: Confirm that code changes are well-documented and that any necessary documentation updates are included.
3. **Feedback**:
   - Provide clear, actionable feedback.
   - Highlight both strengths and areas for improvement.
   - Suggest specific changes or alternative approaches if necessary.

### 5.3. Addressing Feedback
1. **Review Feedback**: The author reviews all feedback and understands the required changes.
2. **Implement Changes**: Make the necessary adjustments to the code based on the feedback.
3. **Update Pull Request**: Commit the changes to the pull request, ensuring that all discussions and feedback are addressed.
4. **Re-Review**: The reviewers re-examine the updated code to verify that all issues have been resolved satisfactorily.

### 5.4. Approval and Merge
1. **Approval**: Once all reviewers approve the pull request, it is deemed ready for merging.
2. **Merge**: The author or project lead merges the pull request into the main codebase following the project's merge policies.
3. **Post-Merge**: Ensure that any necessary post-merge actions, such as deploying to staging or notifying stakeholders, are completed.

## 6. Best Practices
- **Timeliness**: Conduct and complete code reviews promptly to avoid bottlenecks.
- **Constructive Feedback**: Focus on improving the code and processes, not criticizing the author.
- **Consistency**: Apply the same review standards across all projects to maintain uniformity.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly assess and refine the code review process based on team feedback and evolving project needs.
