# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Branching Strategy

## 1. Purpose
This SOP defines the standardized branching strategy for version control to ensure consistent and efficient development workflows. A well-defined branching strategy facilitates collaboration, simplifies integration, and maintains codebase stability throughout the development lifecycle.

## 2. Scope
This procedure applies to all developers and team members involved in writing, reviewing, and deploying code within the organizationâ€™s projects. It covers the creation, management, and merging of branches in the version control system (e.g., Git).

## 3. Definitions
- **Main Branch**: The primary branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a production-ready state. Commonly named `main` or `master`.
- **Develop Branch**: A branch from which feature branches are created and into which feature branches are merged. It reflects the latest delivered development changes for the next release.
- **Feature Branch**: A short-lived branch created from the develop branch to develop a specific feature or fix a bug.
- **Release Branch**: A branch created from the develop branch when the develop branch has acquired enough features for a release. It allows for final testing and bug fixing before the release.
- **Hotfix Branch**: A branch created from the main branch to quickly address critical issues in the production codebase.
- **Pull Request (PR)**: A request to merge code changes from one branch into another, typically reviewed by peers before integration.

## 4. Responsibilities
- **Developers**:
  - Follow the branching strategy for all code changes.
  - Create feature branches for new features or bug fixes.
  - Ensure timely merging of branches following code reviews.
- **Project Leads**:
  - Oversee the implementation of the branching strategy.
  - Ensure that branches are managed correctly and merged appropriately.
- **Reviewers**:
  - Review pull requests to ensure compliance with the branching strategy.
  - Approve or request changes for pull requests as necessary.

## 5. Procedure

### 5.1. Branch Types and Naming Conventions
1. **Main Branch (`main` or `master`)**:
   - Reflects the production-ready state.
   - Direct commits to this branch are restricted and require pull requests.

2. **Develop Branch (`develop`)**:
   - Integration branch for features.
   - Regularly updated with feature branches.

3. **Feature Branches (`feature/<feature-name>`)**:
   - Created from the develop branch.
   - Naming convention: `feature/<descriptive-name>`
   - Example: `feature/user-authentication`

4. **Release Branches (`release/<version-number>`)**:
   - Created from the develop branch when preparing for a new release.
   - Naming convention: `release/<version-number>`
   - Example: `release/1.2.0`

5. **Hotfix Branches (`hotfix/<issue-number>`)**:
   - Created from the main branch to address critical bugs.
   - Naming convention: `hotfix/<issue-number>`
   - Example: `hotfix/urgent-payment-bug`

### 5.2. Creating a Feature Branch
1. **From Develop**: Ensure you are on the develop branch.
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   ```
2. **Create Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
   ```
3. **Develop Feature**: Implement the feature and commit changes.
4. **Push Branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/<feature-name>
   ```
5. **Create Pull Request**: Submit a pull request to merge the feature branch into develop.

### 5.3. Merging Feature Branches
1. **Code Review**: Ensure the pull request is reviewed and approved by at least one team member.
2. **Resolve Conflicts**: Address any merge conflicts before merging.
3. **Merge**: Merge the feature branch into develop.
4. **Delete Branch**: After successful merge, delete the feature branch from the remote repository.
   ```bash
   git push origin --delete feature/<feature-name>
   ```

### 5.4. Creating a Release Branch
1. **From Develop**: Ensure you are on the develop branch with all features merged.
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   ```
2. **Create Release Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b release/<version-number>
   ```
3. **Prepare Release**:
   - Update version numbers.
   - Perform final testing and bug fixes.
4. **Push Branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin release/<version-number>
   ```
5. **Create Pull Request**: Submit a pull request to merge the release branch into both main and develop.

### 5.5. Merging Release Branches
1. **Code Review**: Ensure the pull request is reviewed and approved by team members.
2. **Merge into Main**: Merge the release branch into the main branch.
3. **Tag Release**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git tag -a v<version-number> -m "Release version <version-number>"
   git push origin v<version-number>
   ```
4. **Merge into Develop**: Merge any changes from the release branch back into develop.
5. **Delete Branch**: After successful merge, delete the release branch from the remote repository.

### 5.6. Creating a Hotfix Branch
1. **From Main**: Ensure you are on the main branch.
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. **Create Hotfix Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b hotfix/<issue-number>
   ```
3. **Implement Fix**: Address the critical issue and commit changes.
4. **Push Branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin hotfix/<issue-number>
   ```
5. **Create Pull Request**: Submit a pull request to merge the hotfix branch into both main and develop.

### 5.7. Merging Hotfix Branches
1. **Code Review**: Ensure the pull request is reviewed and approved promptly.
2. **Merge into Main**: Merge the hotfix branch into the main branch.
3. **Tag Hotfix**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git tag -a v<new-version-number> -m "Hotfix version <new-version-number>"
   git push origin v<new-version-number>
   ```
4. **Merge into Develop**: Merge the hotfix branch into develop to ensure the fix is included in future releases.
5. **Delete Branch**: After successful merge, delete the hotfix branch from the remote repository.

## 6. Best Practices
- **Descriptive Naming**: Use clear and descriptive names for branches to convey purpose.
- **Small Commits**: Make frequent, small commits with meaningful messages.
- **Regular Syncing**: Regularly pull changes from the parent branch to minimize merge conflicts.
- **Code Reviews**: Always have code reviewed before merging to maintain code quality.
- **Automated Testing**: Implement automated tests to validate changes before merging.
