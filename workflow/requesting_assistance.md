SOP for Breaking Down a Codebase for Assistance
Purpose
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the steps for breaking down a codebase and providing the necessary context to another person or Large Language Model (LLM) when seeking assistance. The objective is to ensure clear communication of the problem, the structure of the codebase, and any relevant context to facilitate effective help.

Prerequisites
A clear understanding of the problem you are facing.
Access to the codebase and the ability to share or describe it.
Knowledge of the specific sections of the codebase relevant to the problem.
Procedure
1. Define the Problem Statement
Step 1.1: Clearly describe the issue you are facing.

What is not working as expected?
Any error messages or unexpected behavior?
Describe the desired outcome versus the actual outcome.
Step 1.2: Mention any troubleshooting steps you have already taken.

Which parts of the code have you checked or modified?
Any specific tests or debugging methods you've tried?
2. Identify Relevant Sections of the Codebase
Step 2.1: Locate the specific files, functions, or classes related to the problem.

Mention file paths and line numbers if possible.
Provide a brief summary of each relevant sectionâ€™s purpose.
Step 2.2: List any dependencies or modules involved.

Describe any external libraries or internal modules that the relevant code interacts with.
3. Provide Contextual Information
Step 3.1: Describe the overall structure of the codebase.

What is the main purpose of the codebase?
What are the key modules and their roles?
Step 3.2: Explain any configuration or environment-specific details.

Are there any environment variables, configuration files, or setup steps required to run the code?
Mention the operating system, programming language versions, and other dependencies.
4. Share Code Snippets and Examples
Step 4.1: Share minimal, relevant code snippets.

Include only the code directly related to the issue.
Use comments to highlight the specific lines where the problem occurs.
Step 4.2: Provide example inputs and expected outputs.

Share any test cases or sample data that demonstrate the problem.
If applicable, provide the actual output received and how it differs from the expected result.
5. Create a Visual Map (Optional)
Step 5.1: Create a flowchart or diagram of the code structure.

Highlight the flow of data or execution path relevant to the problem.
Use tools like Lucidchart, draw.io, or simple text-based diagrams.
Step 5.2: Annotate the diagram with key information.

Add notes on dependencies, key functions, and areas of concern.
6. Prepare a List of Questions
Step 6.1: List specific questions you have about the problem.

Be concise and focus on what you need help with (e.g., "How can I debug this function?", "Is there a better way to handle this dependency?").
Step 6.2: Prioritize your questions based on urgency and relevance.

7. Compile a Summary Document
Step 7.1: Prepare a document summarizing all the information gathered.

Problem Statement
Relevant Code Sections
Contextual Information
Code Snippets and Examples
Visual Map (if created)
List of Questions
Step 7.2: Format the document for clarity.

Use bullet points, headings, and code blocks for easy readability.
8. Share the Document with the Helper
Step 8.1: Ensure the document is accessible.

If sharing with a person, use a shared document service like Google Docs.
If sharing with an LLM, provide the text input in a concise and structured manner.
Step 8.2: Include any necessary permissions or links.

Provide access to the repository, necessary files, or configurations.
9. Follow Up and Iterate
Step 9.1: Be open to follow-up questions and provide additional information as needed.
Step 9.2: Update the document with any new findings or changes based on the feedback received.
Best Practices
Keep the explanation as concise and focused as possible.
Avoid overwhelming the helper with unnecessary information.
Be clear about what you expect from the helper or LLM.
Use consistent terminology to avoid confusion.
