# SOP for Codebase Generation

## 1. Requirement Collection
Objective: Gather detailed requirements for the project, including functionalities, constraints, and user expectations.

Steps:
- Identify key stakeholders and conduct interviews or surveys.
- Document functional and non-functional requirements.
- Prioritize requirements based on stakeholder needs and project scope.

## 2. Requirement Documentation
Objective: Convert collected requirements into a structured and detailed document.

Steps:
- Create a requirements document that includes a description, use cases, and acceptance criteria for each requirement.
- Validate the document with stakeholders to ensure completeness and accuracy.
- Obtain sign-off from all key stakeholders.

## 3. Initial Codebase Documentation
Objective: Outline the high-level structure of the codebase, including directories, main modules, and architectural design.

Steps:
- Create an overview document with a high-level description of the codebase structure.
- Include an architectural diagram showcasing the main components and their interactions.
- Define naming conventions, coding standards, and development guidelines.

## 4. Modules Documentation
Objective: Detail the specifications for each module, including functionality, inputs, outputs, and dependencies.

Steps:
- Create a separate document for each module with the following sections:
  - Purpose: What the module is responsible for.
  - Interfaces: Input/output specifications.
  - Dependencies: Other modules or libraries required.
  - Constraints: Any limitations or specific considerations.
- Review and validate module documentation with the development team.

## 5. Integration Documentation
Objective: Define how different modules will be integrated into the overall system.

Steps:
- Document integration points and interfaces between modules.
- Specify data flow and communication mechanisms (e.g., API endpoints, shared data structures).
- Outline the sequence of integration steps and any integration testing required.

## 6. Testing Documentation
Objective: Plan and document the testing strategy for the codebase.

Steps:
- Create a testing plan that includes unit tests, integration tests, and system tests.
- Define test cases and expected results for each module and integration point.
- Outline the testing environment and any tools required for testing.

## 7. Implementation Documentation
Objective: Provide detailed instructions on how to implement the documented requirements and modules.

Steps:
- Break down each requirement into implementation tasks.
- Provide pseudocode or flowcharts where necessary.
- Include any technical considerations, such as algorithms or data structures to be used.

## 8. Create Code from Implementation Documentation
Objective: Translate the implementation documentation into executable code.

Steps:
- Assign tasks to developers based on the implementation documentation.
- Write code adhering to the initial codebase and module documentation.
- Perform code reviews to ensure quality and adherence to standards.

## 9. Create Test Units for Code
Objective: Develop automated tests to verify the correctness of the code.

Steps:
- Write unit tests for each module based on the testing documentation.
- Implement integration tests to ensure modules work together as expected.
- Run tests and document results.

## 10. Create Scripts to Integrate Modules for the Codebase Project
Objective: Automate the integration of different modules into a cohesive codebase.

Steps:
- Develop scripts to automate the build and deployment processes.
- Implement scripts to validate module dependencies and compatibility.
- Test the integration scripts to ensure they work as intended.

## 11. Test and Complete
Objective: Verify that the codebase is fully functional and meets the documented requirements.

Steps:
- Conduct a final round of testing, including regression testing.
- Review the entire codebase for completeness and adherence to requirements.
- Prepare a final report and handover documentation.
