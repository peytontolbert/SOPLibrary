# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Standardized Testing Documentation

## 1. Purpose
This SOP establishes a standardized approach for documenting all testing activities to ensure consistency, reliability, and clarity. Proper testing documentation facilitates effective communication, aids in identifying defects, and supports the maintenance and scalability of software products.

## 2. Scope
This procedure applies to all quality assurance (QA) engineers, testers, and development teams involved in the testing phase of software projects within the organization.

## 3. Definitions
- **Test Case**: A set of conditions and variables under which a tester determines whether a system or part of an application is working correctly.
- **Test Plan**: A document outlining the strategy, objectives, resources, and schedule for intended testing activities.
- **Defect**: Any deviation from the expected behavior of the software product.
- **Regression Testing**: Testing existing functionalities to ensure that recent changes haven't adversely affected them.

## 4. Responsibilities
- **QA Engineers/Testers**: Create, execute, and document test cases and results according to this SOP.
- **Test Leads**: Review and approve testing documentation, ensuring compliance with standards.
- **Development Teams**: Address defects documented during the testing process.
- **Documentation Team**: Maintain and update testing documentation templates and guidelines.

## 5. Procedure

### 5.1. Preparation
1. **Refer to the Testing Documentation Checklist**: Before commencing documentation, consult the [Testing Documentation Checklist](testing/SOP_standardized_testing_documentation.md) to ensure all necessary elements are covered.
2. **Access Standardized Testing Templates**: Use the [Standardized Testing Documentation](testing/templates/standardized_testing_template.md) as the foundation for your testing documents.

### 5.2. Documentation Content
Ensure all testing documents include the following sections:

#### 5.2.1. Introduction
- **Project Name**: Clearly state the name of the project.
- **Module/Feature**: Specify the module or feature under test.
- **Objective**: Describe the goals of the testing effort.

#### 5.2.2. Test Plan
- **Scope**: Define what is included and excluded in the testing process.
- **Resources**: List the tools, environments, and personnel involved.
- **Schedule**: Outline the timeline for testing activities.
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies.

#### 5.2.3. Test Cases
- **Test Case ID**: Assign a unique identifier to each test case.
- **Description**: Provide a brief overview of what the test case verifies.
- **Preconditions**: State any prerequisites or setup required before execution.
- **Test Steps**: Enumerate the detailed steps to execute the test.
- **Expected Results**: Define the expected outcome for each test step.
- **Actual Results**: Record the actual outcome after test execution.
- **Status**: Indicate whether the test case passed, failed, or is blocked.

#### 5.2.4. Test Execution
- **Execution Log**: Document the execution of test cases, including dates and testers involved.
- **Defect Reporting**: Detail the process for logging and tracking defects identified during testing.
- **Regression Testing**: Describe the approach for retesting fixed defects and ensuring no new issues are introduced.

#### 5.2.5. Test Summary
- **Summary of Results**: Provide an overview of the testing outcomes, including the number of test cases passed, failed, and blocked.
- **Defect Metrics**: Present statistics on defects found, their severity, and resolution status.
- **Lessons Learned**: Highlight insights and areas for improvement identified during the testing process.

### 5.3. Review and Approval
1. **Internal Review**: Submit the testing documentation to the Test Lead for an initial review.
2. **Feedback Incorporation**: Address any feedback or required changes promptly.
3. **Final Approval**: Obtain formal approval from the QA Manager before finalizing the documentation.

### 5.4. Publication
1. **Repository Integration**: Commit the finalized documentation to the designated repository location, such as `testing/documentation/SOP_standardized_testing_documentation.md`.
2. **Notify Stakeholders**: Inform relevant team members and stakeholders of the new or updated testing documentation.
